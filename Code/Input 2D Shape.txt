For Translation:
(–50, 75): shifts left 50 px and up 75 px
(200, 0): shifts right 200 px with no vertical move
(0, –100): shifts down 100 px with no horizontal move




For Scaling Factor:
2.0 2.0
Uniformly doubles the size of the shape.

0.5 0.5
Shrinks the shape to half its width and height.

1.5 0.75
Stretches horizontally by 50% and compresses vertically by 25%.

2.0 1.0
Doubles width only.

1.0 2.0
Doubles height only.

–1.0 1.0
Reflects across the y-axis and keeps height unchanged.

1.0 –1.0
Reflects across the x-axis and keeps width unchanged.
