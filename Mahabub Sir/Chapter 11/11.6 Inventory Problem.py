# order_cost: Cost of placing an order (100 units). Added when inventory reaches reorder point.
# holding_cost: Cost of holding each inventory unit per period (5 units), calculated based on end-period inventory.
# total_order_cost: Cumulative cost of all orders placed during simulation.
# total_holding_cost: Accumulated holding cost over all periods.
# demand_cumulative_probability: Cumulative probability list for demand levels (%), defining the likelihood of each demand level.
# demand_lst: List of possible demand values; used with demand_cumulative_probability to determine demand each period.
# lead_time_probability: Cumulative probability distribution for order lead times (%), representing different lead time probabilities.
# lead_time: List of lead times (periods), used with lead_time_probability to determine each orderâ€™s lead time.
# inventory: Starting inventory level (8 units), tracking stock available each period.
# n: Number of periods to simulate (30), representing each cycle of inventory check, demand fulfillment, and ordering.
# sell: Total units of demand fulfilled in the simulation.
# lost: Total unmet demand (lost sales) due to insufficient inventory.
# reorder_point: Inventory threshold (3 units) at which a new order is triggered.
# order_quantity: Units ordered when reorder is triggered (5 units), added to inventory after lead time.
